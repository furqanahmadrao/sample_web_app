  "tags": ["work", "meeting", "q4"],
  "is_pinned": false
}
```

### Searching Notes

**Frontend:**
1. Type your search term in the search box
2. Results update automatically as you type
3. Search looks in both titles and content

**API:**
```bash
GET /api/notes?search=meeting
```

### Filtering by Tag

**Frontend:**

2. Only notes with that tag will appear

**API:**
```bash
GET /api/notes?tag=work
```

### Pinning a Note

**Frontend:**
1. Find the note you want to pin
2. Click the "Pin" button
3. The note moves to the top with a üìå indicator

**API:**
```bash
PATCH /api/notes/:id/pin
```

### Archiving a Note

### Combining Filters

- This finds all pinned work notes containing "project"

**API:**
```bash
GET /api/notes?search=project&tag=work&pinned=true
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Organization Tips
1. **Use Tags Consistently**: Develop a standard set of tags and stick to them
2. **Pin Sparingly**: Only pin truly important notes (aim for 5-10 max)
3. **Archive Regularly**: Move completed or outdated notes to archive
4. **Search First**: Before creating a new note, search to avoid duplicates

### Tag Strategies

**By Context:**
- work, personal, study, hobby

**By Status:**
- todo, in-progress, done, waiting

**By Project:**
- project-alpha, project-beta

**By Priority:**
- urgent, important, someday

**By Type:**
- meeting, idea, reference, note

### Search Tips
1. **Be Specific**: More specific terms yield better results
2. **Use Keywords**: Think about key words in your notes
3. **Combine Filters**: Use tag filters with search for precision
4. **Try Variations**: If you don't find what you're looking for, try synonyms

### Workflow Examples

**Daily Work Routine:**
1. Start day by viewing pinned notes (current priorities)
2. Create new notes for meetings with "meeting" tag
3. Tag action items with "todo"
4. Archive completed tasks at end of day
5. Review and unpin completed projects weekly

**Project Management:**
1. Create project notes with project-specific tag
2. Pin active project notes
3. Tag by status: "todo", "in-progress", "review"
4. Archive when project is complete
5. Search project tag to review all related notes

**Knowledge Base:**
1. Create reference notes with descriptive tags
2. Use "reference", "howto", or "docs" tags
3. Pin frequently needed references
4. Use search to quickly find information
5. Update notes rather than creating duplicates
